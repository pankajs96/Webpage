        The main purpose of your About Us page is to give your visitors a glimpse into who you are as a person or a business (or sometimes both).<br/>

As users discover your brand, they need to distinguish what sets you apart and makes you… you.<br/>

This often requires finding the right balance between compelling content and a design carefully planned to look the part.<br/>

Conveying your identity in a fun and approachable – but also reliable and informative – way is challenging.<br/>

If you know who you are and your goal for your site, the About Us page should come naturally.<br/>
